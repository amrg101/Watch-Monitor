# Watch Data Streamer for Wear OS

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) <!-- Optional -->

**A Wear OS application designed for comprehensive sensor data acquisition and seamless transmission to a paired Android phone.**

This app runs directly on your Wear OS smartwatch, providing core functionality to:

*   Collect&Display vital health metrics: **Heart Rate** & **Steps**.
*   Capture contextual sensor data: **Accelerometer**, **Location** & **Device Battery**.
*   Support flexible monitoring modes:
    *   **Continuous Background Monitoring** for ongoing tracking.
    *   **On-Demand Event Recording** for specific incidents.
*   Reliably transmit all collected data to a companion Android phone application using the Wear OS Data Layer API.

Ideal for projects requiring rich sensor data from a smartwatch for further processing, analysis, or integration into larger health and activity platforms on a connected phone.

## üì≤ Phone App Integration

To receive data from this Wear OS app, your companion Android phone application will need to:

1.  **Include Play Services Wearable Dependency:**
    ```gradle
    implementation 'com.google.android.gms:play-services-wearable:18.1.0' // Or latest
    ```
2.  **Listen for Data Layer Messages:**
    *   Implement a `WearableListenerService` or add listeners to `MessageClient`/`DataClient`.
    *   Listen on predefined paths (e.g., `/watch_info/health`, `/watch_info/incident`) for incoming data.
    *   (Specify the exact paths your app uses here or refer to a constants file).
3.  **Process Received Data:**
    *   Deserialize the received data (e.g., from JSON) into appropriate data models on the phone side.

## üîí Permissions (on Wear OS device)

This app requires the following permissions on the Wear OS device to function:

*   `android.permission.BODY_SENSORS`
*   `android.permission.ACTIVITY_RECOGNITION`
*   `android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION`
*   `android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE`
*   `android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE_HEALTH`
*   `android.permission.WAKE_LOCK`
*   `android.permission.POST_NOTIFICATIONS` (API 33+)

---
## üí° Future Ideas
* Adaptive sampling.
* Local caching on watch for offline sync.
* User-configurable settings within the Wear OS app.
